🚀 Free AI Audit for Southwest Michigan Small Businesses

Hey everyone! I'm Dave, a local builder based in Bangor. Marine veteran turned technologist.

I'm offering free 30-minute AI audits where I'll show you 2-3 specific ways AI could save you time or money in your business.

No pitch. No obligation. Just practical advice.

Perfect if you're spending hours every week on:
✅ Data entry & paperwork
✅ Answering the same customer questions
✅ Scheduling & coordination
✅ Creating content or product descriptions
✅ Any repetitive task you wish would do itself

I'll look at your business and tell you honestly what would help (and what wouldn't).

Drop a comment or DM if interested. Happy to help our local business community! 

📅 Book here: [cal.com link]

### Post 2: Website Pain Point
```
Is your website actually bringing you business? Or just sitting there?

Quick question for local business owners:

When's the last time you got a new customer directly from your website?

If the answer is "I'm not sure" or "never," you're not alone.

Most small business websites are:
❌ Too slow
❌ Hard to find on Google
❌ Not mobile-friendly
❌ Missing clear calls to action

I offer a quick Website Checkup ($150, done in 48 hours) where I'll:
✅ Show you exactly what's wrong
✅ Explain why you're not showing up in searches
✅ Give you a simple fix list

Video walkthrough delivered to your inbox. No jargon.

Based in Bangor, serving Southwest Michigan.

### Post 3: Time-Saving Angle
```
How many hours do you spend on admin work every week?

Scheduling.
Emails.
Data entry.
Updates.
Reminders.

For most small business owners I talk to: 10-15 hours per week.

What if you could cut that in half?

I build simple automation tools that handle the repetitive stuff so you can focus on what actually grows your business.

Examples:
→ Customer submits form = automatic email + calendar reminder + added to spreadsheet
→ New booking = confirmation sent + payment processed + your team notified
→ Invoice paid = receipt sent + accounting updated + thank you email

No complicated setup. I build it, you use it.

Starting at $600. Most projects done in 1 week.

### Post 4: Personal Story
```
Why I'm building AI tools for local businesses instead of startups

Quick background:

I'm a Marine veteran who spent years building AI-powered SaaS products and no-code tools.

I've worked with tech companies, built complex systems, and launched products.

But the most rewarding work? 

Helping a local contractor save 8 hours a week on estimates and invoices. Watching a small shop owner finally show up on Google. Building a simple booking system that actually works.

No VC pitches. No growth hacking. No "disruption."

Just practical tools that save real people real time.

That's what I'm focused on now.

If you run a small business in Southwest Michigan and you're drowning in repetitive tasks, let's talk.

### Post 1: Professional Positioning
```
After years building AI tools and SaaS products, I'm bringing that expertise to where it's needed most: small businesses in Southwest Michigan.

Most small business owners I meet are:
→ Working 60+ hour weeks
→ Handling everything from operations to marketing
→ Spending 10-15 hours/week on repetitive admin tasks

But they can't afford a $50K agency project or a full-time developer.

That's the gap I'm filling.

Simple AI tools. Fast websites. Smart automation.
$500-$2,500 projects. 1-3 week turnaround. No agency overhead.

If you know a business owner in Bangor, South Haven, Kalamazoo, or Grand Rapids who's maxed out on time, I'd love to help.

### Post 2: Educational
```
3 tasks every small business should automate (but most don't)

After talking to dozens of local business owners, here are the biggest time-wasters I see:

1️⃣ New Customer Onboarding
Manual: Send welcome email, add to CRM, create invoice, schedule follow-up (20 min per customer)
Automated: All happens instantly when they book/buy (0 min)

2️⃣ Appointment Confirmations & Reminders
Manual: Call or text each customer before appointments (5-10 min per appointment)
Automated: Automatic confirmations and reminders, customers can reschedule themselves (0 min)

3️⃣ Data Entry from Forms/Emails
Manual: Copy info from emails into spreadsheets or CRM (1-2 hours per week)
Automated: Information flows directly to where it needs to go (0 min)

Most of these can be set up in a week and cost less than hiring part-time help for a month.

Interested? I offer free 15-minute calls to see what would help your business most.

## Signature Talk (5-Minute Local Networking Intro)

```
"Hi, I'm Dave Blank. Marine veteran, builder, lifelong learner.

I help small businesses in Southwest Michigan save time with simple AI tools and automation.

Most business owners I meet are working 60+ hour weeks. They're drowning in admin work: emails, data entry, scheduling, all that repetitive stuff that doesn't actually grow the business.

That's what I fix.

I build simple tools that handle the boring tasks automatically, so they can focus on what actually matters.

Not complicated. Not expensive. Just practical solutions that work.

If you're spending more than 10 hours a week on admin work, we should talk.

I'm offering free 30-minute audits where I'll show you exactly how AI could help your specific business.

Come find me after; I'd love to chat."
