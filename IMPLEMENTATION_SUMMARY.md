2. **Verify email** works: hello@daveblank.com
3. **Test Cal.com booking** link: https://cal.com/daveblank

### Optional (Recommended):

2. Add FAQ schema on services page
3. Set up click tracking for CTAs
4. Get pilot clients and add testimonials section
5. Create city-specific landing pages (after initial traction)

## Next Steps (From Oracle)

**Track for 2-4 weeks:**

- Newsletter signups
- Scroll depth to Builder Notes

**After 2-3 client projects:**
1. Add Testimonials component
2. Replace "Why Work With Me" card content with client quotes
