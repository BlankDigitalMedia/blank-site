## Business Automation

**Starting at $600**

Connect the tools you already use so they work together automatically.

## How This Works

1. **Book a call** — Free 15 minutes. We'll talk about what you need.
2. **I send a simple proposal** — What I'll build, timeline, cost. No jargon.
3. **I build it** — You'll get updates. No surprises.
4. **You use it** — I'll stick around for questions and tweaks.

I'm not an agency. I don't have a sales team or account managers. You work directly with me, and I move fast.

## Who I Work With

Small businesses in **Bangor, South Haven, Kalamazoo, and Grand Rapids** who want practical help without the runaround.

You're a good fit if:

- You want results, not buzzwords
- You'd rather talk straight than play business theater

## Common Questions

**Do I need to know anything about tech?**  
Nope. I'll explain everything in plain English and show you exactly how to use what I build.

**What if I need changes later?**  
First month of tweaks is included. After that, we can do a simple hourly rate or small retainer if it makes sense.

**Can you work with my existing tools?**  
Probably. I work with most scheduling, payment, email, and CRM systems. If you've got something weird, I'll tell you up front.

**Do you do ongoing support?**  
If you want it. Most clients don't need it — I build things to be simple and self-sufficient. But I'm around if you do.

**How do I know this will actually help my business?**  
Start with the free audit. I'll show you what's possible. If it doesn't make sense, I'll tell you.
