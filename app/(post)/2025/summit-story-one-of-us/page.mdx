We started before sunrise, when the ridge was still a suggestion—
just darker than the dark. The trail threaded through the pines and
the air had that early-cold that makes every breath feel new.

There was no countdown and no banner, only the quiet work of upward
steps. The kind that trades chatter for cadence, where a group slowly
becomes a pace and the pace becomes a promise.

Halfway up, the wind found us and the world opened. Valleys arranged
like pages below; the horizon, a careful underline. Someone laughed at
the thinness of it all and it broke the spell in the best way possible—
we took turns naming the towns we could not see.

Closer to the summit, rocks replaced trail. Hands learned their part.
A boot slipped, a hand appeared, and none of us made a point of it.
That’s the thing about climbing: the story rarely belongs to one
person, and yet it changes each of us precisely because it doesn’t.

At the top, the wind braided words into silence. We stood there longer
than we planned, not because of the view (which was generous), but
because we found the single, unspoken sentence we’d all been trying to
write since the first step: together was the point.

We ate, we grinned, we promised we’d do it again. And on the way down,
the trail finally felt familiar—like we’d borrowed it and were
returning it a little better than we found it.

If you were there, you know. If you weren’t, you were still one of us.
