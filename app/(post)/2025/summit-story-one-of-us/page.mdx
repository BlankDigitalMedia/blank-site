One of us! One of us!

The chant from the Senior Architect hit me seconds after I sat down and landed harder than he probably meant it to. (Thanks, Erik.)

A few years ago, I never would have believed it.

## Before

Back when I joined Lippert, I was the greenie sitting in a room of pros. People like Erik and Marcus.

Marcus was the senior BSA, the guy everyone still looks to when something breaks. I remember sitting in an RCA meeting, still wrapping my head around mbps, watching him troubleshoot like it was second nature.

I felt useless. Out of place. Sure that my role in tech had an expiration date.

That was seven years ago.

## The day

It had already been a wild morning. Suzie had to go to the ER (she's fine), and by the time I got to the summit, the team had finished intros.

Still out of breath, I gave mine.

"Hey, I'm Dave. Senior Business Systems Analyst and AI tinkerer."

Then came the part I wasn't ready for: something we were proud of.

Most of the team had big wins to share. I serve more in a supporting role, which as a builder can feel... off.

But personal accomplishments were fair game, so I said it.

### What I said

Over the past year, I've been teaching myself to code. Writing JavaScript by hand. In Neovim.

## The chant

The Senior Architect pounded his fist on the table as he chanted, "One of us! One of us!"

The room laughed, but it stuck with me.

<blockquote className="pull">
  The people I used to look up to now look to me. Not because I became them, but because I didn't.
</blockquote>

Later in the summit, I got a text from Marcus.

He said he's been watching my work and keeping an eye on what I'm building next. Coming from him, that hit different.

For the rest of the summit, I felt like one of the nerds. My hard work was finally paying off in ways I didn't expect.

From safety guy to business analyst, and finally, one of the devs.
