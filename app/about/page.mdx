## I help small businesses work smarter, not harder.

I build AI tools, websites, and automations for local businesses in Southwest Michigan: fast, affordable, and without the agency runaround.

### Why I Do This

I can't stand repetitive, meaningless work. 

If you're spending hours on the same tasks every week (data entry, customer emails, scheduling, manual updates), that's time you could be growing your business or living your life. I fix that.

I've spent years building AI-powered tools and SaaS products because I'm obsessed with finding better ways to do things. Now I'm bringing that same approach to small businesses in my community: Bangor, South Haven, Kalamazoo, and Grand Rapids.

### Who I Am

I'm a Marine veteran, builder, and lifelong learner. I live in Michigan with my wife, nine dogs, and fifteen chickens.

I keep things simple. I move fast. I don't waste your time with jargon or business theater.

When I build something for you, it's going to work and you're going to understand how to use it. If it doesn't make sense for your business, I'll tell you that too.

### What Makes Me Different

**No agency overhead.** You work directly with me. I don't have account managers, sales teams, or layers of bureaucracy. Just someone who builds and gives a damn about the result.

**I actually build things.** This isn't consulting. I don't hand you a strategy doc and disappear. I build tools, websites, and systems that work.

**Local and accessible.** I'm here in Michigan. You can meet for coffee if you want. I'm available when you have questions.

**Practical, not fancy.** I'm not trying to win design awards or build the next big thing. I'm trying to save you 10 hours a week and help you make more money.

### My Approach

1. **We talk.** I learn what's actually slowing you down.
2. **I recommend what makes sense.** No upselling, no fluff.
3. **I build it fast.** Most projects are done in 1-3 weeks.
4. **I stick around.** First month of tweaks included. After that, I'm here if you need me.

### Let's Work Together

If you're a small business owner who wants practical help without the complexity, [let's talk](/services).

Start with a free audit or 15-minute call. No pressure, no pitch, just straight talk about what could help your business.
