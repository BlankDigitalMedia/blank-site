I&rsquo;m Dave Blank, a builder and technologist passionate about creating
innovative solutions. My journey spans technology, creativity, and the
ever-evolving intersection of AI and human experience.

With a background in software development and a keen interest in emerging
technologies, I focus on building tools and experiences that make a
difference. My work explores the boundaries of what's possible with
modern technology while maintaining a commitment to clean, thoughtful
design.

I'm currently exploring the potential of AI to augment human creativity
and solve complex problems. When I'm not coding, you'll find me tinkering
with new ideas or sharing insights about technology and innovation.
