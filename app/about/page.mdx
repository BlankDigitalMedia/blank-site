Hey, I’m Dave Blank.
I break things until they make sense.

I do it because I can’t stand repetitive, meaningless work. I want to spend my time learning, building, and finding better ways to do things. I’ll do something a hundred times if it’s a skill worth mastering, but never just because that’s how it’s done.

I’m a lifelong learner. Nothing fires me up like a new challenge or that moment when everything finally clicks. Real accomplishment, the kind that comes from dedication and grit, gets me every time.

Music runs through everything I do. One minute it’s Frank Sinatra, NF, or Hippie Sabotage. The next it’s Colter Wall, Hatebreed, or Griz. My playlists make no sense and I like it that way.

I live in Michigan with my wife, nine dogs, and fifteen chickens. I’m a Marine, always will be. That probably explains my love for structure, chaos, and the color green.

If you like learning by doing, building until it breaks, and breaking it until it’s better, welcome. You’re in the right place.
