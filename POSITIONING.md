## Common Objections & Responses

â†’ "That's exactly why I offer free audits. Let me look at what you're doing and I'll tell you honestly if it makes sense. No pressure."

**"That seems expensive."**
â†’ "I get it. Think of it this way: if this saves you 5 hours a week, that's 20 hours per month. What's your time worth?"

**"Can I think about it?"**
â†’ "Absolutely. Here's what helped my last client decide: [share specific outcome]. Want me to send you their story?"

**"I need to talk to my partner/spouse."**

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Businesses with no budget (hobbyists)
- "Tire kickers" who want free work
- Unrealistic expectations about AI/automation
- Can't articulate their actual problem
- Want you to compete with 5 other quotes

## Quick Wins to Build Momentum

1. **First Client:** Offer beta discount (25% off) for testimonial
2. **Local Press:** Reach out to South Haven Tribune, Kalamazoo Gazette about "local veteran helps small businesses with AI"
3. **Partnerships:** Connect with local business consultants, accountants, marketing agencies for referrals
4. **Free Workshop:** Host "AI for Small Business 101" at local library or coworking space
5. **Case Study:** Document first project in detail for social proof

## Long-Term Positioning (6+ Months)

Once you hit $300/week consistently:
1. Raise prices 20-30%
2. Add retainer/support packages
3. Develop productized services (fixed scope, fixed price)
4. Create group offerings (workshops, courses)
5. Build referral network with other local service providers
