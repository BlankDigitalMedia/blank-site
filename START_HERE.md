## üí∞ Path to $300/Week

### Strategy 1: Quick Wins (Week 1-2)
- Land 2-3 Website Checkups ($150 each) = $300-450
- Fast turnaround builds trust
- Often leads to bigger projects

### Strategy 2: First Real Project (Week 2-4)
- Land 1 Website ($1,200) = 4 weeks of income covered
- Or 1 AI Tool ($500) + Checkups ($300) = $800
- Focus on under-promising, over-delivering

### Strategy 3: Build Pipeline (Week 4-6)
- Convert happy clients to referrals
- Steady stream of $500-1,500 projects
- Add retainer clients ($150-300/month)

## üìä Track Your Progress

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't oversell on first call** - Listen more than you pitch
2. **Don't undercharge** - Your prices are fair for the value
3. **Don't take projects outside your scope** - Stay focused
4. **Don't ghost inquiries** - Respond within 1 hour
5. **Don't forget to ask for referrals** - Every happy client = 3-5 more leads
6. **Don't post and disappear** - Engage with responses
7. **Don't work without a deposit** - 50% upfront is standard

## üéØ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ 3-5 audit bookings per week
- ‚úÖ 30%+ of audits convert to paid work
- ‚úÖ Referrals come in unprompted
